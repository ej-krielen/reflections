What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Depends on wether or not the files dependant on each other to make  a whole project.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Use git log to see which files you need, and both files in the diff to see the differences.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

You can always go back to a working version then find out what went wrong based on changes between those versions.
